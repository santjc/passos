# PassOS

The project aims to develop an open-source ticketing and booking management system. The system will provide a modular and extensible foundation for managing attractions, tours, and events, focusing on simplicity, performance, and scalability.

The initial goal is to build a lightweight backend written in **Go (Golang)** with **PostgreSQL** as the main database. The system will expose a RESTful API to handle attractions, availabilities, bookings, and ticket validations.
